# 📘 Basics and Introduction to Data Pipelines and Apache Airflow

---

## 🧠 What is a Data Pipeline?

Think of a **data pipeline** like a **factory assembly line** — but for data.

- **Data comes from somewhere** (like a website, app, or database).
- It **moves through steps** where it gets cleaned, changed, or analyzed.
- Finally, the **processed data** is stored or sent somewhere else (like a report, dashboard, or database).

**Example:**

- Take sales data from a website every night.
- Clean it (remove errors).
- Add calculations (like total revenue).
- Save the final result in a report or database.

---

## 🛠️ Why Do We Need Data Pipelines?

- Automate boring, repeated data work.
- Handle **big data** that humans can’t manage manually.
- Keep **data clean and updated** every day/hour.
- Help **businesses make decisions** using fresh data.

---

## 🚀 What is Apache Airflow?

Apache Airflow is a **tool that helps you build and run data pipelines**.

- You tell Airflow **what to do** and **when to do it**.
- It will take care of **running your steps** in the right order.
- It shows you a nice web dashboard to **see and control** your pipelines.

---

## ✅ What Can Airflow Do?

- Move data from one place to another
- Run Python scripts, SQL queries, etc.
- Wait for files to arrive (like from S3 or FTP)
- Schedule tasks (like daily at 1 AM)
- Retry failed steps automatically
- Show progress and logs for each step

---

## 📦 Airflow is Best For:

- **ETL** (Extract, Transform, Load) jobs
- **Machine learning pipelines**
- **Data cleanup and reporting**
- **Anything that needs to run in a specific order and time**

## 🧩 Basic Terms You’ll Learn in Airflow

| Term                | Simple Meaning                                      |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **DAG**       | A list of tasks with order and time (like a recipe) |
| **Task**      | One small job (like running a script or SQL)        |
| **Operator**  | How the task is done (Python, Bash, etc.)           |
| **Scheduler** | The one who starts tasks at the right time          |
| **Web UI**    | A website to watch and control your jobs            |


# 🏗️ Apache Airflow Architecture (Very Simple Explanation)

---

## 🧠 What is Architecture?

"Architecture" means how different parts of Airflow work together — like a **team of people**, each with a specific job.

---

## 🧩 Main Components of Airflow

| Part Name                   | Simple Job Description                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scheduler**         | Decides**when to run** each task. Think of it like a **manager** who checks the time and says, “Hey, it’s 1 AM, run this job!”       |
| **Executor**          | Actually**runs the task**. Like a **worker** who does the job assigned by the manager.                                                  |
| **Web Server**        | The**Airflow website** you open in your browser to see, monitor, and control your DAGs.                                                       |
| **Metadata Database** | Stores**everything Airflow needs to remember** — like DAGs, task status, logs, etc. Like the **memory or notebook** of the system.     |
| **Workers**           | If you are running many tasks, workers help by**doing tasks in parallel** (at the same time). Think of them as **extra helping hands**. |
| **DAGs Folder**       | A folder where you**write your workflows (DAGs)** using Python files.                                                                         |

---

## 🔄 How They Work Together

1. You write a **DAG file** (Python code) and put it in the **DAGs folder**.
2. The **Scheduler** reads the DAG and decides **when to run each task**.
3. When the time comes, the **Scheduler tells the Executor** to run the task.
4. The **Executor** gives the task to a **Worker** (if needed).
5. The **task runs**, and the status (success/failure) is saved in the **Database**.
6. You open the **Web UI** to see logs, progress, errors, etc.

---

## 🖼️ Simple Real-Life Example:

- You are the **Airflow system**.
- A notebook is your **metadata DB**.
- Your alarm clock is the **scheduler**.
- You check your notebook every morning (DAGs).
- You do tasks (executor/worker).
- You show your work to your teacher (Web UI).

---

## 💡 Notes:

- Airflow uses a **database** in the background (usually PostgreSQL or MySQL).
- **Celery Executor** and **Kubernetes Executor** are used for running tasks in big systems.
- In small setups, **LocalExecutor** is enough.

---


# 🖥️ Apache Airflow Web UI (Very Simple Explanation)

---

## 🧠 What is Airflow UI?

The **Airflow UI** is a **website** that lets you see, control, and monitor your workflows (called DAGs) easily.

You can open it in your browser using a link like:
`http://localhost:8080` (if running locally)

---

## 🧭 What Can You Do With Airflow UI?

- ✅ See which **DAGs** are running or scheduled
- 🔄 Manually **trigger or restart** a workflow
- 🔍 Check **logs** for each task (to debug errors)
- ⏰ See when a task ran, and how long it took
- 📊 View your workflow as **charts and trees**
- ❌ Turn DAGs on or off

---

## 🧩 Main Sections in the UI

| Section Name                    | What It Shows / Does                                                      |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DAGs Page**             | List of all your DAGs. You can trigger, pause, or delete them.            |
| **Tree View**             | Shows DAG structure like a**family tree** — tasks linked in order. |
| **Graph View**            | DAG shown in a**flowchart style**. Easy to see task flow.           |
| **Gantt View**            | Shows task**run time** as bars on a timeline.                       |
| **Code View**             | Shows the actual**Python code** of your DAG.                        |
| **Task Instance Details** | When you click on a task, you can:                                        |

- See logs
- Retry it
- Mark it as success/failed manually |

## ✋ Common Buttons and What They Do

| Button           | Use For                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| ▶️ Trigger DAG | Manually run a DAG immediately           |
| ⏸️ Pause DAG   | Stop the DAG from running on schedule    |
| 🔁 Clear         | Re-run tasks by clearing their old state |
| 📄 Logs          | See what happened when task ran          |
| ✅ Mark Success  | Manually mark a task as completed        |

---

## 📌 Useful Tip

If your DAG is not showing up:

- Check if the DAG file is saved in the **dags/** folder
- Make sure the DAG has `dag_id` and `schedule_interval`
- Check the **Web UI** to see if it's paused (grey) or active (green)
