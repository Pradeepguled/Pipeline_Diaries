## Disagreeing Respectfully to Reduce Customer Impact

### Questions :

* Tell me about a time when you  **disagreed with your manager** .
* Tell me about a time when you  **took ownership beyond your role** .
* Tell me about a time when you  **put customers first** , even when it wasn’t your responsibility.
* Tell me about a time when you had to  **balance short-term customer impact with long-term process** .
* Tell me about a time when you  **earned trust during a production issue** .

## STAR :

### **Situation**

We had an issue in the **alert engine** where some alerts were missed for a few customers due to a  **Kafka configuration problem on the platform / DevOps side** .

Because the root cause was outside our team, my manager suggested that we  **wait for the platform team to fix it** .

One of his key concerns was that:

* If we start fixing platform issues manually,
* It could set a precedent,
* And break the  **long-term operating model** , where each team owns its responsibilities.

---

### **Task**

My responsibility was to:

* Reduce **immediate customer impact**
* While also respecting **long-term team boundaries**
* And not create a pattern that would cause confusion in the future

So the challenge was to balance **short-term customer needs** with  **long-term process discipline** .

---

### **Action**

I acknowledged my manager’s concern and agreed that breaking ownership boundaries permanently would be a problem.

I then proposed a  **controlled approach** :

* Treat the manual trigger as a **one-time, temporary workaround**
* Clearly document that this was **only to reduce customer impact**
* Make it explicit that the **platform team still owned the root fix**

I explained that:

* Customers were currently seeing empty dashboards
* Alert history was not being captured
* Waiting would protect the operating model, but **hurt customer trust**

After discussion, I convinced my manager that this would not change ownership, but would **bridge the gap** until the platform fix was deployed.

---

### **Result**

* Alerts were manually triggered for affected customers
* Dashboards started showing alert values again
* Alert history was preserved
* Once the platform fix was live, the manual process was stopped
* The operating model remained intact
* Onshore stakeholders appreciated the balanced approach

---

### **Learning**

This taught me that:

* Long-term operating models are important,
* But they should not come at the cost of **immediate customer impact**
* It’s possible to disagree respectfully while still protecting structure and process
* Clear communication prevents temporary actions from becoming permanent expectations

Since then, I always look for **temporary, well-defined solutions** that protect customers without breaking long-term systems.

---

### 🔑 **One-line summary**

> I disagreed respectfully and proposed a temporary workaround that protected customers without breaking the long-term operating model.

This STAR shows:

* **Backbone with maturity**
* **Customer-first thinking**
* **Respect for process**
* **Senior judgment**
